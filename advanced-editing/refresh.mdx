## Replacing One Screen in a Tour

**To replace a screen in a tour:**
    1. Click on the "Replace" button in the left menu. This will open the URL to that screen and the Chrome extension.

    <img height="800" width="400" src="/images/replace-screen-in-tour.png" />

    2. You can recapture the screen with the updated UI or replace it by capturing any other screen.

**Alternatively, you can:**
    1. Delete the screen from the video.
    2. Add a new step.
    3. Upload a new screen PNG or JPG.

## Replacing a Tour Manually

**To rerecord a published tour:**
    1. Go to the "Template Settings" menu.
    2. Click on "Refresh (Beta)".
    3. Select "Re-record". This will open the URL to the beginning of the screen and the Chrome extension.

    <img height="800" width="400" src="/images/replace-tour-manually.png" />

    4. You can recapture the tour with the updated UI or replace it by capturing any other flow.

## Replacing a Tour Automatically

<Tip>
  **Tip:** Run a test first to check if the steps can be auto-refreshed.
</Tip>

To automatically rerecord a published tour:

    1. Go to the "Template Settings" menu.
    2. Click on "Refresh".
    3. Select "Auto-Refresh". This will open the URL to the beginning of the screen, and our bot will auto-capture the same flow with the updated UI.

Watch the tour below to see this in action.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingTop: '56.5%' }}>

## Reviewing your published flows

There are a few ways you can review published flows. 

### a. Testing a flow

You can run a test to check if the steps in the published flow are still valid with the latest UI. Our bot opens a new tab in your browser and runs through the same steps.

<Note>
    **Note:** You must be in the same logged in / logged out state as the original capture to let the bot run the test.
</Note>

To run a test,
    1. Go to ‘Template Settings’
    2. Select ‘Refresh (Beta)’
    3. Click on ‘Test Flow’

    <img height="800" width="400" src="/images/test-hexus-flow.png" />

    ✅ If the test is a success, you will see a success message like this:

    <img height="200" width="400" src="/images/hexus-test-successful.png" />

    ❌ If the bot is unable to proceed after a certain step due to a change in the UI, then you will see a pop up as shown below in the same tab:

    <img height="200" width="400" src="/images/hexus-test-unsuccessful.png" />

    Additionally, you will see this message in the ‘Template Settings’ modal.

    <img height="200" width="400" src="/images/hexus-test-unsuccessful-notification.png" />

### b. Search for a flow

Hexus indexes all your flow titles, captions, URLs and UI elements so that you can search for a particular flow by the elements that were captured in it. You can start a search in your dashboard, and check the box to search across the entire catalog.
    
    <img height="200" width="400" src="/images/search-for-hexus-flow.png" />
    
    1. Search by URL: If you need to update a screen that appears across many flows, you can simply search by URL.
    2. Search by UI element: If you need to update flows that contain a specific CTA, you can simply search by the name of the CTA.
    3. Search by flow title or caption: You can find a flow by searching for the text in the title or in any of the captions on the hotspots or text-to-speech.

### c. Notifications

You can set up in-app notifications or email notifications as a reminder to manually review your flows at your desired frequency. For example, if your team has a major release every quarter, you can set up quarterly notifications to review your flows and check if they are up to date. Here’s how you can set up notifications:

<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingTop: '53.5%' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/7813002e-f28b-4952-8743-c1d7ec6ab627"
    title="Hexus Flow Review Notification"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
  ></iframe>
