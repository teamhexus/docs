## How to embed multiple filetypes in your demos
Hexus demos provide an excellent platform for showcasing your ideas with dynamic and diverse content. If you need to include various file types like PDFs, Google Drive files, or Figma designs within your Hexus demos for added customer actions, this guide will walk you through the process of embedding these.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
    <iframe
        src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/66f4386b-9ef3-4393-9fe9-31ccfc983ec0?refid="
        title="Hexus Embedding Multiple Filetypes"
        frameborder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
        allowfullscreen
        style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
    ></iframe>
</div>

Here's how to get the embed code for all the different filetypes:

## Troubleshooting
If you're unable to see your embed in the Hexus Flow, try the following fixes:

**File Access:** Ensure your Google Drive files are set to public access to avoid access issues.

**Incorrect Embed Code:** Double-check that the iframe code is copied correctly. Even a small error can prevent the file from displaying.

**Compatibility Issues:** Some browsers may not support certain embed codes. Testing your demo in multiple browsers can help identify and resolve these issues.
