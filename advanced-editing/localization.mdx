To create localized URLs of your flows, you need to be on our Growth plan. Translation for text and audio is available in 11 languages. Languages included are English, Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Italian, Dutch, Russian, Portuguese, Arabic. To request a specific language, contact us at team@hexus.ai.

Here’s how you can enable localization for your product tours:

Contact us for audio or video translation. Contact us for closed captions for your localized tours.

For users on a starter plan, while you cannot generate unique URLs with standard locale codes, you can still translate your flows into one of our 11 languages and share it as a unique link.
