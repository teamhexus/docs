**Alternatively, you can:**
    1. Delete the screen from the video.
    2. Add a new step.
    3. Upload a new screen PNG or JPG.

## Replacing a Tour Manually

**To rerecord a published tour:**

    2. Click on "Refresh (Beta)".
    3. Select "Re-record". This will open the URL to the beginning of the screen and the Chrome extension.

## Replacing a Tour Automatically

To automatically rerecord a published tour:

    1. Go to the "Template Settings" menu.
    2. Click on "Refresh".
    3. Select "Auto-Refresh". This will open the URL to the beginning of the screen, and our bot will auto-capture the same flow with the updated UI.
