  <Accordion title="Can it record my Desktop or Camera?">
    The Chrome extension can record anything within the browser. However, to record anything outside the Chrome browser:

      4. Click on “Record your screen” or “Record your Camera”. You will be able to edit and trim these videos when you’re done recording.

  <Accordion title="Does it record screenshots or video?">
    The Hexus extension records screenshots unless the “Record scrolling & typing as video steps” checkbox is checked in the Extension. If checked, Hexus will record a video snippet when you’re scrolling or typing for longer than 5 seconds.

  <Accordion title="What if it can’t capture my screens?">
    You can set up your [keyboard shortcuts](https://hexus-ai.notion.site/a918de9ff63c4f1887a1e4828796dee8?pvs=25) to capture screens that the extension doesn’t. They will still be added to your flow, so you don’t need to stitch them together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I pause my recording?">
    Yes. Just open the extension after you’ve started recording, and click on “Pause recording”.  You can click on “Continue recording” when you’re ready to capture your screens again. Additionally, if you open the Page Editor from the Chrome extension in the middle of your recording, the recording will be paused until you close the Page Editor.
