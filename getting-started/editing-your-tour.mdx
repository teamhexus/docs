## Adding a page
You can add a page anywhere in a tour with custom fields, for example to create a cover slide or an end slide. Below are some ideas on how to create pages to enhance customer engagement:

<div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', paddingTop: '56.25%' }}>
      <iframe
            src="https://app.usehexus.com/embed/5f3140e0-3bbf-49db-95c0-748b5da87a5f"
            title="Adding a page in a Hexus flow"
            frameborder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
            style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
      ></iframe>
</div>

Here, you can import steps from other Hexus flows, upload your media, record your desktop, or record from our Chrome extension.

## Combining Steps in the How-to Guide

            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
            allowfullscreen
            style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
      ></iframe>
</div>

## Player and step settings
Additionally, we support adjusting the iframe under “Player Settings” toolbar for accessibility, responsiveness and other settings such as:
  1. **Closed Captions:** This is available on the Growth & Enterprise plan. You can generate a transcript if your flow has audio.
  2. **Play in loop:** By default, the interactive tour or video will not play in a loop. To enable autoplaying in a loop, turn the toggle on in the step settings toolbar.
  3. **Background Music:** You can select one of our preset background music options. Enterprise plans support adding your own background music.
  4. **Aspect ratio:** You can update the aspect ratio for your flows by adjusting the width and height, and clicking Update.
  5. **Watermark:** Hiding watermark is only available on our paid plans. Enterprise plan holders can add your own watermark.
  6. **Step settings:** You can control the duration of the step or playback speed under Step settings toolbar.
  7. **Product Demo Video Animation:** You can customize how your product video animates in the Step Settings by changing the animation type.
 <img height="400" width="800" src="/images/animating-product-video.gif" />
  8. **Mobile settings:** You can toggle the 'Show in Mobile' option on in Player settings for your flows so your customers can view your tours on mobiles seamlessly as well. The flow will render as a video instead of an interactive tour.
<img height="400" width="800" src="/images/adjust-device-settings.gif" />
  9. **Fixed CTA:** With this option, you can add a CTA on every step of the demo at a fixed location. You can use this to drive conversions for example "book a demo" or "sign up" or "view help center".
