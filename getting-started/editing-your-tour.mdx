Here, you can import steps from other Hexus flows, upload your media, record your desktop, or record from our Chrome extension.

## Player and step settings
Additionally, we support adjusting the iframe under “Player Settings” toolbar for accessibility, responsiveness and other settings such as:
  1. Closed Captions: This is available on the Growth & Enterprise plan. You can generate a transcript if your flow has audio.
  2. Play in loop: By default, the interactive tour or video will not play in a loop. To enable autoplaying in a loop, turn the toggle on in the step settings toolbar.
  3. Background Music: You can select one of our preset background music options. Enterprise plans support adding your own background music.
  4. Aspect ratio: You can update the aspect ratio for your flows by adjusting the width and height, and clicking Update.
  5. Watermark: Hiding watermark is only available on our paid plans. Enterprise plan holders can add your own watermark.
  6. Step settings: You can control the duration of the step or playback speed under Step settings toolbar.
