## SOC 2 Compliance

SOC 2 is an audit report developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA).

The audit evaluates controls related to security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy of a system.

There are two types of SOC 2 reports:
    - Type I: checks if a company is compliant at a point in time.
    - Type II: confirms that a company is still compliant during an observation window (typically 6 months).
