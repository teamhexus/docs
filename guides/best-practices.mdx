Crafting compelling interactive product tours is key to attracting customers and showcasing your software. This is a complete guide to creating the best learning experiences for your customers.

<Info>
üåü **Here‚Äôs why you should use interactive product tours over static videos for product education:**

1. **üìà¬†Higher engagement**: Interactive tours have 2.5x higher CTR and completion rates than static videos. Take your learning content up a notch by fully leveraging the value of interactive tours and utilizing interactive components like CTAs and forms.
2. üß† **Effective learning**: Interactive demos can simulate the experience of your product in a safe environment. Create multi-path "choose your own adventure" flows easily to maximize learning for viewers.
3. ‚è±Ô∏è **Self-paced**: Bite-sized information that's easy to digest can be broken down into self-guided tours, allowing users to learn at their own pace.
4. üéØ **Easy to customize & personalize**: Interactive tours are 10x easier to edit than videos. You can leverage personalization to create targeted content for different audiences. Plus, it's easy to keep your tours up-to-date as your product evolves.

Follow these best practices to create tours that engage your audience and drive conversions:

## 1. Define Your Target Audience and Use Cases

Before creating your interactive tour, clearly define your target audience and the specific use cases your product addresses. Tailor your tour content to speak directly to your ideal customer's pain points and demonstrate how your product solves their problems. Create multiple tours for different personas or use cases to provide a more personalized experience.

## 2. Keep Your Tour Concise and Focused

Aim to create a tour that is concise and focused on your product's core features and benefits. Keep the number of steps in your demo between 10 and 15, with each dialog box containing around 25-30 words. Keep your audience engaged and keep their attention without overloading them with information.

## 3. Use Compelling and Inviting Language

When crafting your tour‚Äôs copy, use language that is both compelling and inviting. Incorporate words like "easy," "simple," and "love" to emphasize your product's user-friendly nature. Additionally, use personal pronouns like "you" and "your" to create a more engaging and relatable experience for your audience.

## 4. Incorporate Multiple CTAs Throughout the Tour

Include 1 or 2 calls-to-action (CTAs) throughout your interactive tour to guide users towards the next steps in their journey. Popular CTAs include "Book a Demo," "Free Trial," and "Additional Tours." Place CTAs strategically within your tour, such as around steps 11 and 15, to maximize engagement and conversions.

## 5. Consider Ungating Your Tour

While gating your tour with a form can help capture leads, ungated tours often have higher completion, engagement, and click-through rates. If lead generation is a priority, consider placing a form later in the tour (e.g., after step 5) or offering multiple CTAs throughout the tour to strike a balance between user experience and lead capture.

More on adding a form [here](/advanced-editing/lead-capture-form).

## 6. Optimize Your Tour‚Äôs Placement and Promotion

To maximize your interactive tour‚Äôs visibility and engagement, place it prominently on your website. Consider adding a full-screen demo accessible via a "Take a Tour" or "Start Tour" CTA button above the fold or in the navigation bar. If you have a complex product or multiple target audiences, create a tour library that showcases different features or use cases.

## 7. Continuously Iterate and Improve

Regularly analyze your interactive tour‚Äôs performance and gather user feedback to identify areas for improvement. Experiment with different content, CTAs, and placement strategies to optimize engagement and conversion rates. As your product evolves, update your tours to reflect new features and benefits.
