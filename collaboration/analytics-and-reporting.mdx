<Tip>
**Hexus Tip:**
    1. More focused demos tend to resonate best. We usually suggest leading with a 10-15 step "Quick Tour" that spotlights your core value proposition. You can always supplement this with modular deep dives into specific capabilities.
    2. Sprinkling in CTAs at strategic points—generally around steps 5, 10 and 15—can significantly lift conversion rates.
    3. Tailor the initial experience to first-time visitors, educating them on your key differentiators. Power users can self-select into more advanced feature walkthroughs.

## Key Metrics

1. **Views**: This metric represents the total number of times your demo has been viewed.
2. **Unique Visitors**: The Unique Visitors metric indicates the number of distinct individuals who have viewed your demo.
3. **Completion Rate**: This metric measures how engaging your demo is by showing the percentage of users who complete the entire demo.
4. **Unique Visitors by Browser**: Hexus Analytics provides a breakdown of unique visitors based on the web browser they use.
5. **Unique Visitors by OS**: Similar to the browser breakdown, Hexus Analytics also shows the distribution of unique visitors across different operating systems.

## **What events can be propagated?**

Most events that happen inside an Hexus can be propagated.  Contact us at [team@hexus.ai](mailto:team@hexus.ai) to enable the event propagation to your integrations. Here are some common events:

- **`Flow Rendered`**: Triggered when a Hexus is initially viewed.
- **`Hotspot Clicked`**: Triggered when a hotspot is clicked.
- **`Flow Ended`**: Triggered after a video step has completed.
- **`Flow Restarted`**: Triggered when a Hexus is replayed.
- **`Percentage Completed`**: Percentage of the flow completed by the user
- **`Step Reached`**: Triggered when the viewer navigates to a new step.
- **`Overlay Clicked`**: Triggered when the viewer clicks on a button within a Page overlay.
- **`External Url Clicked`**: Triggered when the viewer clicks on a URL within a hotspot or callout.
- **`CTA Clicked`**: A convenience "meta-event" that combines the two events above (**`Overlay Clicked`**, **`External Url Clicked`**).
