## HubSpot

Hexus enables seamless integration with HubSpot to optimize lead capture and management from interactive product tours. By connecting your Hexus account with your HubSpot portal, you can automatically capture and manage leads generated from Hexus tours.

### a. How to integrate

Connect to HubSpot through the integrations page and grant the required permissions. Once integration is complete, check if new Hexus property (Hexus URL) is created.

Contact us at [team@hexus.ai](mailto:team@hexus.ai) for any other properties.

### b. Workflows

    1. **Lead Capture:** Hexus automatically creates a contact in HubSpot whenever a lead fills a Hexus form. Remove any filters from your contacts table to view the newly created contacts. Learn more on how to add a form [here](https://www.notion.so/d578b7b81f0543fca4babb41f158c1db?pvs=21).

    3. **Landing pages:** Embed iframe on to HubSpot landing pages directly. You can also create and run an A/B test on your landing page, and embed variants of a product tour. Hexus collects key metrics such as the number of viewers, completion rate, and click-through rate for each product tour. Analyze this data in conjunction with your HubSpot A/B test results to maximize conversion rates and customer engagement.
    4. **Email sequences:** Embed Hexus tours into your email sequences for new feature announcements, onboarding, lead nurture, and more. You can personalize your tour using name and email variables in Hexus & HubSpot. Learn more about personalization [here](https://www.notion.so/ea3d7951ecca49a1935b49cdda25066c?pvs=21). More on how to use Hexus tours in email sequences [here](https://www.notion.so/2708f2461c104dd0a806e43a21f14678?pvs=21).

## Intercom

Hexus videos can be downloaded as MP4 and added to your Intercom articles. However, you can embed Hexus videos as iframes into Intercom’s custom answers.

To get started, follow these steps:

    1. **Create a Messenger App**:
        - Log in to the Intercom Developer Hub.
        - Set up a new Messenger app in the Canvas Kit using the Sheets mode. This allows you to embed iframes within the Messenger.
    2. **Configure the App**:
        - Use the provided documentation for Canvas Kit to configure your iframe settings. This will involve specifying how your Hexus videos are loaded within the Messenger window.
    3. **Publish and Install the App**:
        - Publish the Messenger app and install it into your customer's Intercom workspace.
    4. **Add to Workflow**:
        - In the Intercom workspace, go to the custom answers section.
        - Add the Messenger app to the workflow using the “Send an app” action.
        - Users will interact with Hexus videos directly within the Messenger window via the iframe.
    5. **Test and Refine**:
        - Ensure everything works seamlessly by testing the integration in different scenarios and refine as needed.
